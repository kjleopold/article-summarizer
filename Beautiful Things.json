  "lyrics": "For a while there, it was rough\nBut lately, I've been doin' better\nThan the last four cold Decembers I recall\nAnd I see my family every month\nI found a girl my parents love\nShe'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all\nAnd I thank God every day\nFor the girl He sent my way\nBut I know the things He gives me, He can take away\nAnd I hold you every night\nAnd that's a feeling I wanna get used to\nBut there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you\n\nOh, I hope I don't losе you\nMm, please stay\nI want you, I need you, oh God\nDon't take\nThеse beautiful things that I've got\n\nPlease stay\nI want you, I need you, oh God\nDon't take\nThese beautiful things that I've got\n\nOh, ooh\nPlease don't take\n\nI found my mind, I'm feelin' sane\nIt's been a while, but I'm finding my faith\nIf everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?\nOh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough\nI've got peace and I've got love\nBut I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all\n\nPlease stay\nI want you, I need you, oh God\nDon't take\nThese beautiful things that I've got\n\nOh, ooh\n\nPlease stay\nI want you, I need you, oh God\nI need\nThese beautiful things that I've got"
